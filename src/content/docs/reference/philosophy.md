# Game Design Philosophy

This document outlines the core design philosophy for the game. It serves as a guide for every major decision during development. If a mechanic, system, or element doesn't align with these principles, it doesn't belong.

## Tactical Gameplay without Complexity Overload

* Positioning, movement, and action choices must be meaningful.
* Avoid bloated modifiers, excessive math, or endless token tracking.
* Every decision should feel clean, decisive, and high-impact.

**Focus on tactical depth, not unnecessary complication.**

## Player-Driven, Not Luck-Driven

* Attacks always hit. Players are never frustrated by "whiff" rolls.
* Players roll the dice and determine outcomes. Enemies do not roll.
* Tension should come from player decisions and damage results, not random success or failure.

**Skill and smart choices matter more than pure chance.**

## Narrative Depth without a Dungeon Master

* The world evolves directly based on player actions and mission outcomes.
* No DM or GM is required. Solo and coop players can fully experience the game.
* Exploration and events should be curated and meaningful, not purely random.

**The story grows from what players do, not from dice tables.**

## Streamlined Characters Defined by Gear and Traits

* Characters are shaped by what they carry, the abilities they gain, and the scars they earn.
* No large stat blocks. No traditional attribute scores.
* Keywords, equipment, and special abilities define identity.

**Characters are created through choices, not piles of numbers.**

## Miniature Agnostic, World Expansive

* Any miniatures can be used. Creativity is encouraged.
* Procedural world generation builds an open, living campaign map.
* The game is not tied to proprietary models or forced assets.

**The system empowers players to use whatever they already love.**

## Accessible, Modular, Expandable

* Core rules should fit on a few pages or a set of cards.
* Expansions add new abilities, enemies, and regions without bloating the core.
* New players can pick it up easily, but the game remains deep for long-term play.

**Simple at the core. Expansive in possibilities.**

If a rule, expansion, or mechanic ever conflicts with these principles, the principles take priority.
