                  I’m running a mostly solo TTRPG campaign and turning the results into a story—written posts, a podcast, and the occasional video. No prewritten plot. No retakes. Just me, some dice, and a stack of rulebooks stitched together into something strange and personal.

The backbone is Old School Essentials, but I’m pulling in mechanics and flavor from wherever they make the story better. Think of it as a Frankenstein ruleset driving a world that’s alive, evolving, and often dangerous.

What you’ll get here:

Written chapters—novel-style, documenting the story as it unfolds

Podcast episodes—atmospheric narration with sound design

Behind-the-scenes content—tools, rolls, and thoughts on the process

This isn’t traditional actual play. It’s not fully scripted fiction either. It lives in between—an ongoing campaign shaped by randomness, ruled by instinct, and told in a way that (hopefully) pulls you in.

If you like dark fantasy, solo projects with soul, and stories where the outcome isn’t fixed... stick around. Let’s see where it goes.
