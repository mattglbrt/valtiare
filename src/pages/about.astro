  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About This Project</h1>
  
  <p class="mb-4">
    I’m running a solo TTRPG campaign and turning the results into a story—
    written posts, a podcast, and the occasional video. No prewritten plot. 
    No retakes. Just me, some dice, and a stack of rulebooks stitched together 
    into something strange and personal.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    The backbone is <span class="italic">Old School Essentials</span>, but I’m pulling 
    in mechanics and flavor from wherever they make the story better. 
    Think of it as a Frankenstein ruleset driving a world that’s alive, 
    evolving, and often dangerous.

  <div class="mb-4">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What you’ll get here:</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Written chapters</strong> — novel-style, documenting the story as it unfolds</li>
      <li><strong>Podcast episodes</strong> — atmospheric narration with sound design</li>
      <li><strong>Behind-the-scenes content</strong> — tools, rolls, and thoughts on the process</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p class="mb-4">
    This isn’t traditional actual play. It’s not fully scripted fiction either. 
    It lives in between—an ongoing campaign shaped by randomness, ruled by instinct, 
    and told in a way that (hopefully) pulls you in.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    If you like dark fantasy, solo projects with soul, and stories where the outcome 
    isn’t fixed... stick around. Let’s see where it goes.
